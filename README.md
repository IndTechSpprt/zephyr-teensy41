# Zephyr Teensy 4.1 Development Template

## Introduction
This template is based on the blinky sample bundled with Zephyr (https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/tree/main/samples/basic/blinky) and the test repo https://github.com/bdkrae/zephyr_teensy4_test. It is designed to serve as a starting point for new application development.

## Features
Given this is a basic sketch, at present it only has 2 main functions:
  - Blinking of the onboard LED to demonstrate GPIO configuration 
  - Printing LED States on the console to demonstrate console configuration - based on the USB console sample provided by Zephyr https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/tree/main/samples/subsys/usb/console.
